# hello-world
This is the repository I am using to complete the GitHub tutorial. Further it is going to be used for testing and stuff

My favourite languages so far are C and Java. I have been experiencing with Assembly lately, and that's something I do not wish upon my worst enemies.

I think I should learn C++ soon, as it comes from C and is Object Oriented (which is something I am truly passionate)
